Guess My Number
This code will let you play a guessing game with your computer.
The goal is to guess the number your computer is thinking, the number will be in the range of 1-1000.
You have an unlimited amount of tries to guess the correct number, but if you know the secret you should be able to get it in your first 10 tries or less.

To start the game after running the code, then you wil be asked if you'd like to play a game.
You can answer using the lowercase and uppercase versions of 'y' or 'n'.

After that you will be prompted for your name and the game will begin.
As I said before, it should only take you at most 10 tries to guess the correct number.
Each time you make a guess you will be told if that number was too low or too high, this will help you narrow down your options.
You will receive a different message depending on how many guesses it took for you to beat the game.

Have fun!
